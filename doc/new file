Observer - this was used when implementing in game statistics.  A Statistics
class was created to observe the Game class for changes.  When an event in the
Game warrants an update into one of the many stats the Statsitics class keeps
track of, the Observeable (Game) notifies the Observer (Statistics) to make
changes to stats.  The GameStatsFrame observes the Statistics class and paints
the panel as stats come in from the Game.

Singleton - the Map class is a singleton.  The Map class has a static map instane
that is constucted only once if when trying to retrieve the map, the map was null.
A new map is then created - guaranteeing only one instance of it exists during a game.
You can only get it by calling Map.getInstance().
